Github remote repository

On github repository
https is the address of the github repository

"git remote add origin httpsUrlOfRepositoryOnGithub"
-origin is the name of the remote, and theoratically it can be called anything else, but by convention it is recommended to keep the name origin because most programmers are used to the conventional namings
The remote is created, so we can push our local repository to the remote repository called origin

"git push -u origin master"
The code above push the local repository to the remote repository using the u flag/u option, which likes the remote and local repository
The content is pushed toward the remote called origin, to the master branorigin 
The master branch is the default branch or the main branch of all the commits

On github going to insights, network then graphs, we can check the number of commits done by the number of points, displaying each point the commit messages.

In the main page (<>Code), clicking on commits, we can see the commits and when the commits happened. Clicking on the commits, the changes will be displayed at those time points
