Forking and Pull Requests

Forking is when someone make a copy of the remote repository into his own remote repository.
Forking a remote repository make the repository owned by the person and has full permission to do whatever to do with the copy of the repository.

Write access to specific people can be made on github, where they can change the source code (done when working in a team). Forking will create a copy and not change to original code.

If user A fork a repositoy from another account B, he will have a copy of the repository on his account (A). He can clone it as well to his local machine.
User A can work on the code, add, changes, and push the work to his own repository (A). If A is not in the trust zone and only have access to read, the only option for A is the send a pull request to B, a suggestion changes for B to incorporate it or merge it into B repository, and B has the deciding vote.

If B approved the request, B can pull the request to his own repository and merge A repository with B repository.The changes will be reflected into a new commit in B.

Merging the repo into the original rep will create a separate branch starting from the original with the content merged. All the contributors will be listed as well according to what was merged
